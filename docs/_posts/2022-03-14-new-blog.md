## What is Sprint Canoeing?

It's a sport where a paddler kneels on one knee, contorting their body with a single-bladed paddle to move a long, skinny canoe as fast as possible while staying upright at the same time.

## How do you move a Canoe when you paddle only on one side?

They can only paddle on one side, either the left or right. They control the direction of the canoe by using several different types of strokes with their paddle:
   J-stroke: this turns the canoe towards the same direction as their paddle
   C-stroke: this turns the canoe away from the direction of their paddle
   Draw-stroke: this pulls the canoe sideways, towards the same direction as their paddle
   Pry-stroke: this pushes the canoe sideways, away from the direction of their paddle
